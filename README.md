#Blender2.8-SelectionMode-Menu
This pie menu allows for quick access to basic functions through the pie menu. Switching from **Object** to **Edit** mode is as simple as opening the menu and choosing whichever selection mode you wish to use. The plugin also allows for easy switching between **wireframe, solid** and **rendered** modes.
